# overload

### Introduction

overload is a web application for downloading directories. Think of it as _wget for your browser_

### Installation

The easiest way to install overload is cloning the repository and then executing

``` bash
go run *.go
```

from the directory. You need to run the binary from the same folder as the `web` folder
of the repository to access the web interface.

### Usage

You can either add new files using the web interface or do it manually via the exposed API
